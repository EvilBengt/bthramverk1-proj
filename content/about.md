This website
------------

This page is my final project in the course "Webbaserade ramverk och designmönster"
(Web based frameworks and design patterns) on [BTH](https://www.bth.se/) (Blekinge institute of technology).

The source code for the site can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/EvilBengt/bthramverk1-proj).
The site is built on the [Anax framework](https://github.com/canax) and backed by a MySQL/MariaDB database.
